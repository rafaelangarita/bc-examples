# BC Examples

Here, you can find some examples of BCs and dummy senders. These BCs were automatically generated by the Social Communication Platform. 
All examples use AMQP as the Social Communication Platform protocol and were generated for the Node.js environment.

## AMQP to SMTP

- Dummy Producer:

There is a AMQP producer written for Node.js.

## HTTP to SMTP

- Dummy Producer:

There are two types of the HTTP producer: one sending **x-www-form-urlencoded** data; the other sending **json** data. Both types of producers are available in Java and un curl.

## BC Configuration

Configuration parameters depend on the type pf the BC; however, all configuration files are located in the conf folder inside the BC's root folder.

## BC Execution

The main file of BCs is called **start-bc** and it is located inside the BC's root folder. To execute a BC, you have to run this file. How to run it depends on the platform the BC was generated for.

- *Node.js BC execution*: node start-bc.js

To run the examples in this repository you have to:

- configure both sender and receiver BCs;
- run both BCs;
- run a dummy producer;

Then you can watch the console output of both BCs to see the sending and reception of messages.
